        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Most of us like spaghetti so why not give baked spaghetti a go? 
        It may not suit everyone but a crispy surface and stretchy cheese are two of the best ways to satisfy your comfort food cravings.
    It takes much longer than simply cooking the spaghetti but I find the effort to be worth it because I prefer pasta dishes baked. It allows the flavors of all the ingredients to sink in.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and cook the pasta. Meanwhile in a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink. Stir in spaghetti and tomato sauce and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta, cream of mushroom combine soup and sour cream and in two 8 inch square baking, dishes, layer half the meat sauce, pasta, soup mixture, cheese. Repeat layers.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake 55-65 minutes or until cheese melts.</li>
