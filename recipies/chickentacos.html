        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you have a slow cooker and you want to save some time when you get home for dinner, you can quickly assemble some delicious tacos with meat already prepared. I would
            recommend making some extras because it is said that this dish tastes better a day or two after it's made. You can refrigerate leftovers for up to 4 days if you place them in an airtight container.
        I haven't made these but I predict they will be much more delicious than getting tacos at fast food restaurants like TacoBell.

            <li>Place chicken in a 3-qt. slow cooker. Combine lime juice and chili powder; pour over chicken. Cook, covered, on low until chicken is tender, 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken. When cool enough to handle, shred meat with 2 forks; return to slow cooker. Stir in corn and salsa. Cook, covered, on low until heated through, about 30 minutes. Place filling on tortillas; if desired, serve with sour cream, pickled onions, lettuce and cheese.</li>
